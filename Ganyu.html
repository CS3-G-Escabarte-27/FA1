			<h1>You chose Ganyu</h1>
				<img src = "Ganyu.jpg">
				<ul>
					<li>Ganyu is a half-adeptus, half-human hybrid that makes sure everything you ask her to do, be done. She doesn't leave anything unfinished. She has the appearance of a young woman with blue hair and goat horns that people mistakenly think is a headdress.</li>
					<li>Ganyu is usually very meek, mild-mannered, and reserved due to her half-qilin heritage, and is easily flustered. She also completes whatever is given to her, whether it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so. Privately, she tends to snap whenever people speak ill of Beidou or the Geo Archon. She greatly respects her fellow adepti, especially Xiao and Cloud Retainer, seeing them as a mentor and a maternal figure respectively, although she becomes extremely anxious in the latter's presence due to her tendency to unintentionally ramble.</li>
					<li>Ganyu has served as the non-stopping secretary of the Liyue Qixing for thousands of years. The more important the task is, the more effort she puts into it, but she also becomes increasingly nervous and is more prone to making mistakes.</li>
					<li>She has a huge work schedule, often working overtime and is prone to falling asleep. As a result, Ganyu has very few friends outside of work. Due to her age, she is very forgetful, and she often forgets important details which causes her much embarrassment. She is very sensitive about her horns, weight and childhood, becoming visibly flustered when any of these three are mentioned in front of her.</li>
