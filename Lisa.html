			<h1>You chose Lisa</h1>
				<img src = "Lisa.jpg">
				<ul>
					<li>Lisa is a proficient witch; as such, she enjoys everything related to the elements and items that would help her understand them. Despite her position as Librarian, Lisa takes it somewhat haphazardly as she appears to be relatively bored dealing with normal books, instead preferring those in the restricted section. She still takes the job seriously nonetheless, and will personally go out to collect books that are long overdue, albeit in a way that she can still enjoy the smaller things in life.</li>
					<li>Her haphazard, carefree personality comes from her time in Sumeru Akademiya, as while studying there she noticed the types of effects the pursuit of knowledge can have on a person. She studied in the Spantamad school for two years and left Sumeru shortly after graduating,relegating herself to categorization and management of the library and usually refusing to take any other duties unless absolutely necessary. Despite repeated pleas from Gafoor to return to the Akademiya, Lisa refuses to give up her life in Mondstadt.</li>
					<li>When Lisa is angered, the surrounding air near her becomes electrified in part due to her Electro Vision. Depending on the severity of what has angered her, she can either be simply irritated or become extremely scary, the latter also causing her to dispense "appropriate" punishment.</li>
					<li>Lisa seems to be fond of the Traveler, and sometimes acts flirtatious, referring to them as "cutie" or "darling," and admitting that they're special to her. She loves tea and thinks that afternoon tea is the most important part of her day. She sometimes takes tea with vegetable soup as she once used to enjoy this with Jean at the Good Hunter restaurant. She also suffers from cucurbitophobia, a fear of pumpkins.</li>
